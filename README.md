# FLI
File structure:

1. Source codes of  the proposd algorithm and all compared algorithms are stored in the file 'Algorithms'.
2. Source codes of  all test problems  are stored in the file 'Algorithms'.

How to run?

1. Directly running the main file in MATLAB (version 8.4 or the later version ) will open a graphical interface.
2. In the left side of the graphical interface, first select an algorithm and a test problem, then press the 'run' button.
3. The solving process is shown in the plot area that is in the middle side of the graphical interface. 
4. After the running terminates, metric values (like IGD and HV) can be ontained  in the right  side of the graphical interface.
